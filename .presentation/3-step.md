03 sampling
-----------------
what is sampling, it's the server initiating a conversation and says to the client
I'm delegating this task to you (cause you have an LLM), when do we do that?
Example: I create a blog post and the server asks for help with tags
Example 2: the server needs help with generating product descriptions based on keywords

a sample request: system prompt, the prompt to run, the model to use and other config. Human in the loop, you decide what to actually run
