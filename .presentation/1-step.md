01 INSTALLING
-----------------

- Installing means we add an entry to an `mcp.json` file that's either placed in an app directory, differs per OS, or we place it in a .vscode directory so it's installed for that repo/session

- once you install, 
  o it shows in this list and also shows the tool available, 
  o also show installed servers in the VS Code extension tab

DEMO, we can install this remote Microsoft Docs server and run it
DEMO 2, we can install this server doing X that we built

DEMO 3: installation looks a bit differently depending on what type of transport you use, transport answers "where" your server lives.
  - type:http or stdio or sse, sse and http needs a url
